**Project 1 : Denver crime scene**

This is a project I completed concerning crime in Denver. It was built in R Studios using ggplot2 and other R packages.
To achieve this project, I made use of some data processing, data cleaning, data assessment, data analyzing. It was fun and I was able to generate some vital information such as: 
* Neighborhoods with the highest number of crime
* The days of the week with the highest number of crime
* Days of the week with the lowest number of crime
* Most crime committed 
* Least crime committed
